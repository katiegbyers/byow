Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?

A: The hexagon would be the rooms and hallways. The teeselation would be the random generation.

-----
Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A: I think I would write the adding a room or hallway method.

-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: A hallway is a pathway, whereas a room is an actual place. They are similar because they are both a non-empty space.

Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A: I feel like I tried to tackle the hardest part first. But it seems to be easier to start with the smaller parts and build from there,.

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A:
